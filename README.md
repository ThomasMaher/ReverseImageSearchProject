## The Project
### Part 1
A pretrained ResNet50 model is used to extract feature embeddings of the <a href="http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/">lfw</a> images. The notebook for <a href="https://github.com/ThomasMaher/NYU-AI-Project/blob/main/reverse_image_search.ipynb">Part 1</a> explains the model in detail and steps in detail. The `reverse_image_search` function can be used with a path to an input image and an array of the extracted features from the database to find the n most similar items to the input. The function will plot the input and results, and return the formatted ouptut images.
